this script allows you to use our SVG icons as background images, or wherever you need a .svg file instead of the
normal inline SVG that svg_icon() outputs.  It's great for using as background images in your CSS.

When you call this image, you have three variables that can be used: 
 i - Icon.  Specify the icon you'd like
 s - size.  Specify the size of the icon
 c - Color. Specify the color

To use these attributes, you must call the icon using URL GET variables.  
If I wanted a blue facebook icon that was 32 px tall, I would call it like so:
 <img src="images/svg.php?i=facebook&s=32&c=blue" />

If I want to use it in my CSS, it's the same idea-
 .class{
 	  background-image: url('../images/svg.php?i=facebook&s=32&c=blue');
 }
